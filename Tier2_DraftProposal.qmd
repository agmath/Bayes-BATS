# Overview

We propose to create several activities which introduce and utilize Bayesian Inference techniques in a variety of contexts. These activities could be used as a vehicle for including data analysis and inference within a course from the corresponding context domain or as a collection of applied activities for use within a statistics course.

# Detailed Proposal

This project seeks to create several activities/modules which introduce Bayesian inference topics in a variety of contexts. The modules will be written as activities that could either be inserted into a course in the context domain or used as an activity in an applied statistics course. 

Each activity will be self-contained in order to increase adoptability within courses that aren't statistics-focused. For example an instructor for a course on *Field Methods and Ecological Principles* could utilize a finished version of our [Chytrid Fungus in Frogs activity](https://agmath.github.io/WebRtutorials/chytrid_prop_est_activity.html) as a single day discussion on statistical analysis of field data. Similarly, an instructor for a course in *Microeconomics* could utilize a future activity on distribution of profits from monopoly and non-monopoly controlled industries. For statistics courses, having activities written in a variety of contexts may permit students flexibility to choose to work within a context that they care about, while still gaining exposure to the desired topic.

To further increase the likelihood of adoption, the activities will be written using `{WebR}`, which allows users to write and execute R code from a web browser. That is, neither students nor the instructor would need a local installation of R in order to utilize these activities. This provides a no-stakes gateway into statistical computing. See our draft proof of concept on [Chytrid Fungus in Frogs](https://agmath.github.io/WebRtutorials/chytrid_prop_est_activity.html).

## Possible Bayesian Topics and Domain Contexts

Initially, we envision the following activities.

### From the *Prior* to the *Posterior*

This activity family explores allowing observed data to update our assumptions. These activities provide an intuitive first-exposure to Bayesian thinking.

  + **Applications in Biology:** prevalence of a mutation within a population, prevalence of a disease within a population, physiological measures on animal populations
  + **Applications in Chemistry:** molecular weights of polymers with a particular starting monomer but using different catalysts and additives (or vice-versa) 
  + **Applications in Environmental Science:** distributions of water purity metrics (turbidity, conductivity, pH, etc.)
  + **Applications in Business and Economics:** monthly/weekly expenditures on raw materials, yearly revenue, salary distributions
  + **Applications in Social Science:**
  + **Applications in Criminal Justice:**

### Estimating a Population Parameter

This activity family explores the notion of extracting and interpreting credible intervals from a posterior distribution.

### Comparison of Population Parameters Across Populations

This activity family considers sampling from posterior distributions and comparing the results of counter-factual draws.
